                  The name "Bartica" derives from an indigenous word meaning "red earth," a reference 
                  to the distinctive reddish soil that characterizes this region. This rich, mineral-laden 
                  earth has been both a blessing and a defining feature of the area for millennia.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  For indigenous peoples, this red earth was sacred, providing fertile ground for 
                  cultivation and containing medicinal clays used in traditional healing practices. 
                  The soil's color comes from high iron oxide content, the same minerals that would 
                  later draw gold miners to the region.

              The late 19th and early 20th centuries brought dramatic change to Bartica with the 
              discovery of gold and diamonds in the interior. Overnight, the quiet settlement became

              Prospectors, merchants, adventurers, and fortune-seekers from around the world flooded

              became a supply center, a place to rest and resupply before heading into the bush, 
              and a market for the gold and diamonds brought back from the claims.
